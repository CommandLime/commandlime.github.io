    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div id="about">
        <p>my name is Chris! i have a physics degree, half a diagnostic radiography degree, and 5 years of messing with
            databases and web-based apps for an NHS mental health trust. that wasn't actually my job, but as an
            administrator who likes to press F12 on web pages a lot it just sort of happened.</p>
        <p>i've fiddled with stylesheets and jquery and dabbled in VBA.</p>
        <p>i like shoegaze and making worse shoegaze, in addition to video games and watching football. i have been
            trying to make an interactive champions league table which better explores the new format.</p>
        <p>one day i hope to own a house, with a room dedicated to instruments i don't know how to play, and effects
            pedals i don't know how to use.</p>
